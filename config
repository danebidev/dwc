# WIP
# Example config, you should edit this 
# and place it in ~/.config/dwc/config

# Spaces between arguments get collapsed to a single one but
# you can preserve them by quoting with double quotes ('"')
# Quoting also allows you to input special characters ('{', '}', '#')

# Execute commands on compositor start with 'exec'
# Commands get executed with sh -c '$command'
exec foot
exec xwayland-satellite
exec swaybg -i /path/to/wallpaper.png

# Set config variables with 'set'
# These do not get passed as environment variables to child processes
set mod super

# Set environment variables with 'env'
# These do get passed as environment variables to child processes
env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP dwc

# Bind commands to keybind combinations with 'bind'
# Valid modifiers are (case-insensitive): 
# 'shift', 'caps', 'ctrl', 'alt', 'mod2', 'mod3', 'super' and 'mod5'
# Currently the valid subcommands are 'exec', 'terminate' and 'reload'
bind $mod+Return exec foot
bind $mod+Escape terminate
bind $mod+shift+r reload
